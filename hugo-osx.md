Erica,

Here is a list of things you'll need to install on your computer.   Not sure how tech savvy you are but how about I just tell you what to install and if you have issues then I can help you.   When it's all installed then I have a script you run that launches everything and thus creates this editing/versioning/collaboration system.  When it's all up and running then we can do a tutorial together.

So here are the pieces you need to install with links to pages on how to do that.
Not sure how tech savvy you are but how about I just tell you what to install and if you have issues or get stuck then I can help you or finish the installs.   When it's all installed we get you push/pull access to our repository, you clone a copy then I have a script you run that launches everything and thus creates this editing/versioning/collaboration system.  When it's all up and running then we can do a tutorial together.

So here are the pieces you need to install with links to pages on how to do that.

1.  Hugo - the static website generator  http://gohugo.io/overview/introduction
     In order to install hugo you need to install first Homebrew and to install homebrew you need to install xcode and the command line tools.

When homebrew is running then
 Just run>    brew install hugo.
from a terminal
2.  Git-the version control software

3.  Smartgit - a graphical interface for git

5.  Sublime 3 Text editor.
http://www.sublimetext.com/3
after installing install the package control
https://sublime.wbond.net/installation
after that install the sidebarenhancements and markdownediting packages.
to install packages from sublime choose
Preferences>package control
then choose Install package
then type in the package name and you can click on the name it brings up and it's installed.

In this system one writes content in a text editor (sublime) using a simple syntax called markdown.

Also need you to install teamviewer and then email me your teamviewer id shown when you launch the program.  This is a desktop sharing program and will be how I help you on your computer.
